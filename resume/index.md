From the first time I started using computers, I knew that this was an industry I wanted to be involved in. My family bought our first computer when I was about 10. Eagerly excited to get it up and running, I was told to wait until our family friend who was into "computers" came over to set it up. Needless to say I didn't wait, got the thing running (no instruction manuals, obviously :) and my love for computing went from there.

I'm passionate about new technologies, if there is a new, better way of solving a problem, I'm all over it! I'm also a huge proponent of open source; contributing to open source projects and putting your work out there is both satisfying and rewarding.

## PROJECTS

### Media Registry

At Tumblr, I designed and implemented a new media registry application that provides a centralised database for all media (images, video, audio) that is hosted by the platform.
The intention of this project was to reduce the amount of duplicate data being stored by having a single instance of any media item, and to provide additional metadata about media to allow Trust & Safety to better protect Tumblr's users.

### GDPR

At Tumblr I designed and implemented the majority of the GDPR compliance software. This involved building user dashbaords to download their personal data, along with data aggregation pipelines to pull all of the data connected to a user from both online (mysql, memcached, redis) and offline (hive, hadoop) data stores.
Through this system, Tumblr met its obligations under Verizon Media to deliver compliance before the required legal cutoff in 2018.
